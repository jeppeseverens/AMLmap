### AML compendium
This is a compendium of transcriptional (RNA-seq) data of primary 1224 AML patients, from five different studies. Both uncorreted and corrected counts are supplied. The data was used for: "paper reference" 

Besides gene expression data it includes: 
1. Clusters
2. Aberration data (mutations, fusions and karyotyping data)
3. Type of mutation, VAF, and amino acid affected
4. Ranking of variability of genes.
5. WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 diagnoses inferred from aberration and meta data
6. FAB annotations 
7. Blast percentage
8. Cell type and immuno phenotype scores
9. Ex-vivo drug response data
